This respository cotains solutions and explanations with details about advanced concepts in CSS3. 

## What are the 3 main Principles of to write good HTML and CSS in order to build amazing websites? 

```Sass
    (1) - Responsive Design;
    (2) - Maintanable and scalable code;
    (3) - Web Performance; 
 ```  

### 1. Responsive Design
It means we build websites that work and render correctly across all screen sizes on all devices. A responsive design includes: 
      - Fluid layouts
      - Media Querries
      - Responsive Images
      - Correct Units
      - Desktop-firs vs mobile-first strategy

### 2. Maintanable and scalable code
More important for developer than for the final user of the website. Writing maaintanable and scalable code means to write code that is CLEAN, easy to understand, supports future growth and above all is REUSABLE. In order to write maintanable and scalable code we need to think about our CSS Arhitecture which is the way we organize our files, how we name our classes and how we structure our markup in HTML.
        - CLEAN
        - Easy to Understand
        - Reusable
        - Growth
        - How to Organize Files
        - How to Name classes
        - How to structure HTML
 
### 3. Web Performance
Last but not least is the Web Performance, making an Website or App more performant means to make it faster and smaller in size, so that the user downloads less data. Now that are many things that affect performance and some factors have nothing to do with our code, but some of the things we can do is to make as little HTTP requests as possible, meaning that we should include as little as possible files in our HTML Document, write as little code as possible, compress our code and use a preprocessor as SASS. The biggest impact that we cam have on performance is to actually reduce the use of images, because images are what makes up by far the biggest part of the size of a website. We can do so by using only images that are really necessary for a website or app and also by compressing this images so that we use less bandwidth for the final user:
        - Less HTTP Requests
        - Less Code
        - Compress Code
        - Use a CSS Preprocessor
        - Less images
        - Compress images
